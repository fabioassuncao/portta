// Applying saved settings, from the panel.
//
// Traefik reads its static configuration from the environment its container was
// created with (ADR 0003), so a saved setting takes effect only once the gateway
// containers are *recreated* — and recreating them means Compose, which this
// process deliberately cannot reach (ADR 0008). The host closes that gap by
// preparing one container, stopped, whose command is fixed at creation time:
// `portta up`, with no argument this panel can influence. Starting a container
// is a permission the panel already had. See ADR 0026.
//
// Every field below is read back from that container rather than remembered
// here, because the apply recreates this process: whatever we held in memory is
// gone by the time there is an answer to report.
