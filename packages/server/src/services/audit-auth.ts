// These endpoints have no Portta service behind them — signing in, signing
// out, turning on a second factor and changing your own password are the
// library's, and reimplementing them to get a log line would be the worst
// possible reason to reimplement them.
//
// So this observes the exchange instead: the path that was called, the status
// that came back, and nothing else. A failed sign-in records the address and
// the email that was tried, because that is the line somebody reads after a
// break-in attempt; it records no password, and it says nothing about whether
// the address exists.
