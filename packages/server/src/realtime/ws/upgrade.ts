// the request still has headers, so the same principal resolver every route
// uses answers the same question here, and a refusal is an HTTP status on a
// socket that is then destroyed. A refused handshake that leaves the socket
// open is a client waiting forever for a server that has already decided.
//
// One listener, not one per route (`01 §5`): several `upgrade` listeners on
// one server all receive every upgrade, and the ones that do not recognise the
// path leave the socket hanging unless every one of them agrees who cleans up.
