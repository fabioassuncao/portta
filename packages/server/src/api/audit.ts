// Writing an audit line from a route.
//
// `03 §9` says the services write these, and where a Portta service owns the
// write that is exactly what happens (`services/users.ts`). The operational
// endpoints are different: starting an environment, removing a container and
// opening a bridge are Docker calls with no database in them, and this
// codebase already records their *activity* from the route for that reason.
// The audit line goes where the activity line goes, so the two cannot drift.
