// Node, never jsdom: everything here is a service, a route or a repository, and
// a browser environment costs roughly ten times what this one does.
//
// The timeouts are generous because the first test in each file pays for
// compiling PGlite's WebAssembly — about three seconds, once per worker. Every
// test after it costs a hundred milliseconds, and the default five seconds
// failed the first one in each file and nothing else.
//
// `hookTimeout` matters as much as `testTimeout`: a suite that signs somebody
// in builds its database in `beforeAll`, and with forty-odd files competing for
// the machine that boot passed ten seconds often enough to fail a full run
// while passing every time the file was run alone.
