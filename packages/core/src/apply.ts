// The applier container: the one thing on a host that may drive Compose on the
// panel's behalf.
//
// Traefik reads its static configuration from the environment its container was
// created with (ADR 0003), so a setting the panel saves takes effect only once
// the containers are *recreated*. Recreating them means Compose, and the panel
// deliberately cannot reach it (ADR 0008): its Docker permissions stop at
// start, stop, restart and one fixed container shape.
//
// So `up` prepares a single-purpose container, stopped, whose command is fixed
// at creation time and reads nothing from the panel. Starting it is a
// permission the panel already has. See ADR 0026.
//
// This is the source of truth. scripts/lib/apply.sh carries a second
// implementation because `up` must work with no Node on the host (ADR 0015),
// and tests/unit/apply.test.sh runs both and compares the `docker create`
// argument lists rather than asking anyone to keep them in step.

/**
 * Why the applier is not a Compose service.
 *
 * `up` runs `--remove-orphans`, and Compose decides what is orphaned by the
 * `com.docker.compose.project` label, then by whether the service is still in
 * the project. A Compose applier would therefore remove *itself* mid-run the
 * moment the overlay left the file list — which is precisely what happens when
 * the panel writes PORTTA_APPLY=false and then applies. It also has to survive
 * the `up` it ran, or its exit code and logs are gone and the panel has nothing
 * to report. A plain container carries no project label and is never a
 * candidate.
