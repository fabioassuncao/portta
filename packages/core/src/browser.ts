// What a browser bundle may import from this package.
//
// `index.ts` re-exports the modules that read the host: config, env, paths,
// password, protections, projects-home, repos-scan. Every one of them pulls
// `node:fs`, so a bundler asked to follow the package's main entry either
// fails or quietly ships a shim. This entry exists so the panel's UI and the
// contract package can share the same derivations the CLI uses — slug,
// hostnames, task and activity vocabulary, capabilities, pressure — without
// dragging the host in.
//
// The rule for adding a module here: it must not import `node:*`, directly or
// through anything it imports. `tests/unit/boundaries.test.sh` fails if one does.

// `export type` emits nothing, so naming it here costs no bundle.
