# Workspace boundaries: who may import whom
# ============================================================================
# The monorepo's shape is a decision, and a decision nothing enforces is a
# suggestion. An import that crosses the wrong way does not fail to compile —
# npm workspaces resolve every package from the same node_modules — so it is
# caught here instead, in milliseconds, against the map in docs/monorepo.md.
#
# The permitted edges:
#
#   contracts -> core
#   db        -> core
#   auth      -> db, contracts
#   server    -> core, contracts, db, auth
#   web       -> core, contracts, db, auth, server
#   cli       -> core, contracts
#   apps/auth -> core
#
# Only `src/` is checked. A package's build scripts and its suites may reach
# further — packages/contracts generates its OpenAPI document from the server's
# routes — because nothing a consumer loads follows them.
#
# A package that does not exist yet passes: packages/db and packages/auth arrive
# in later phases of the migration, and the rule is written before they do so
# the first import in them is already governed.
