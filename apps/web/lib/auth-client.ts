'use client'

// The browser's half of Better Auth.
//
// Sign-in, sign-out and the second factor are the library's endpoints, called
// through its own client so the cookie handling, the error shapes and the
// two-factor redirect are the ones it documents. Everything Portta decides —
// who may do what, which projects they see — comes from `/api/auth/me` instead,
// because those are Portta's rules and the client plugin does not know them.

  // somebody else's host.
