'use client'

// The panel's one WebSocket client.

// Following a log used to mean asking for the last 200 lines every three
// seconds: three requests for the same lines, a gap of up to three seconds
// before anything appeared, and a burst of work on the host every time
// somebody left the tab open. This holds one connection and receives what
// Docker sends.
//
// It reconnects, because a panel behind a proxy loses connections for reasons
// that have nothing to do with the panel, and it gives up saying so, because a
// viewer that reconnects forever is a viewer that never tells you the stream is
// not coming back.
