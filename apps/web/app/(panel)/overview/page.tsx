 * rather than a spinner. From there the client keeps it alive: the same query
 * refetches on its interval, and `lib/live.ts` invalidates it when Docker says
 * something changed.
 *
 * `services.*`, never `fetch('/api/…')`: the request would leave the process,
 * come back through the same dispatcher, and pay for a round trip to reach code
 * this render already has.
