 * inside it are not, so the boundary sits here rather than around each page.
 *
 * It is also the one entrance every page comes through, which is why
 * authentication is decided here rather than in a proxy: a proxy would run on
 * every asset, could not reach the database, and would answer a question this
 * already answers once per render.
