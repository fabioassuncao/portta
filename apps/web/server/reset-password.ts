// A self-hosted panel has no mail transport, so there is no reset link. What
// there is instead is this: a script that runs on the host that owns the panel,
// inside its container, where the database URL already is. Being able to run it
// means having the machine, which is the same authority the owner had when they
// created the account.
//
// `portta auth reset-password <email>` is what runs it; the password arrives on
// stdin so it is never in a shell history, in `ps`, or in whatever collects
// both. Nothing is printed but the email.
