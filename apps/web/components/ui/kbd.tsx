 * that is nearly always Linux and is read on a machine that is often not. Read
 * at import time it made the HTML say `Ctrl` and the first client render say
 * `⌘`, which is a hydration mismatch — and React answers one by throwing the
 * server's tree away and rebuilding the whole panel in the browser.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` is the sanctioned way to say "the server cannot know
 * this": it hands React the server's answer while it hydrates and the real one
 * on the render immediately after, so the only cost is a re-render nobody sees.
